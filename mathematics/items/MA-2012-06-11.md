The numbers in the table show a *linear relationship* between x and y because there is a *constant rate of change* between values of x and values of y. Every time x decreases by 2, y decreases by 4. To find the equation that describes this linear equation, we first need to find the rate of change, which is called the *slope* of the line (usually represented by the letter *m*), and it is calculated as

$$slope = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{(y_{2} - y_{1})}{(x_{2} - x_{1})}$$

Because a linear relationship has a constant rate of change, we would
find the same slope for any pair of (x, y) points in the table. Notice
that as we move down rows of the table, x decreases by 2 (a change of
-2) and y decreases by 4 (a change of -4). So,

$$slope = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{- 4}{- 2} = 2$$

The slope is 2. The only equation among the answer choices that has a
slope of 2 is Choice A.

We can confirm that the equation in choice A works for each entry in the
table, by calculating 2x+3, and confirming that quantity is equal to y:

***x***  | ***y*** |  ***2x + 3*** 
---------|---------|----------------
2        | 7       |  2(2) + 3 = 7
0        | 3       |  2(0) + 3 = 3
-2       | -1      |  2(-2) + 3 = -1
-4       | -5      |  2(-4) + 3 = -5
