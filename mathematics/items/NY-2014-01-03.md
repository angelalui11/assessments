There are 18 candy bars in each bag. So, for example, if Jeremy has 2
bags of candy, he would have enough candy bars for 2 x 18 = 36 children.
If he has 3 bags, he would have enough for 3 x 18 = 54 children. In
general, if he has *c* bags of candy bars, he has enough for 18*c*
children. Jeremy wants to give each child at least one candy bar, and
since he is inviting 80 children, he needs at least 80 candy bars. That
means that 18c has to be greater than or equal to 80, which is written
as \( 18c \geq 80 \) which is choice A.
