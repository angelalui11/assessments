To find the equation of a line connecting two
points, we first need to find the *slope* of the line. The slope is a
number that measures how steep the line is, and it is calculated as

$$slope = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{(y_{2} - y_{1})}{(x_{2} - x_{1})}$$

The slope is usually abbreviated with the letter *m*. The problem gives
us two x values and 2 y values, in the two points provided. We can call
either one y~1~ or y~2~ as long as we choose x~1~ and x~2~ in the same
order. Using the two points given,

$$m = \frac{(4 - 1)}{( - 2 - - 1)} = \frac{3}{- 2 + 1} = \frac{3}{- 1} = - 3$$

The slope is -3. Now to find the equation of the line, we use the
*point-intercept form* of the equation of the line:

$$\left( y - y_{1} \right) = m(x - x_{1})$$

We need to use one of the provided points for (x~1~, y~1~). We can use
either one, but from looking at the 1s in the answer choices, it looks
like we should use (x~1~, y~1~)=(-1,1).

Substitute the slope and the point into the point-slope form of the
equation and we get:

$$\left( y - 1 \right) = - 3(x - - 1)$$

Or

$$y - 1 = - 3(x + 1)$$

Which is choice B.
